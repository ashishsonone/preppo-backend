- try to understand indexes in mongodb by creating demo collection of news items with following schema
  {
    title,
    approved, //true/false
    approvedBy, 
    approvedAt, //when last approved
    date, //news publish date
    createdAt, //when created
    createdBy
  }

ANALYSIS 1:
-----------------

DB under consideration:
  created news entries ~160 distributed across 10 weeks
  approved vs non-apporved ration 3:1
SCRIPT:
  https://github.com/ashishsonone/learn-backend/tree/master/mongodb_insert

QUERIES LIKE:
  db.News.find({approved : true}).sort({date : 1}).limit(10);

WITHOUT INDEX:
  need to scan all for any such query

SIMPLE INDEX on {date : 1}
  why : since we will want the results to be sorted by 'date' key
  db.News.find({approved : true}).sort({date : -1}).limit(20).explain("executionStats")
    returned : 20
    examined : 24
    it will go through the 'date' index and since mostly {approved : true} documents, it needs to examine only few extra false positives

  db.News.find({approved : false}).sort({date : -1}).limit(20).explain("executionStats")
    returned : 20
    examined : 85
    it will go through the 'date' index but only will find few {approved : false} documents. Hence need to examine a lot more to find those 20 documents

COMPOUND INDEX on {approved : 1, date : 1}: 'approved' key first
  why : since most of the queries will explicitly specify whether they want approved docs or not hence it makes sense to make approved first key for the compound index
  db.News.find({approved : true}).sort({date : -1}).limit(20).explain("executionStats")
    returned : 20
    examined : 20
    the compound index makes it more easier(earlier it had to examine a few false positives also)

  db.News.find({approved : false}).sort({date : -1}).limit(20).explain("executionStats")
    returned : 20
    examined : 20
    now using the compound index, it will only go through the non-approved documents in date order way
